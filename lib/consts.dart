String description = "Never Let Me Down is a song by American rapper and producer Kanye West, that features Jay-Z and J. Ivy, from West's debut studio album The College Dropout (2004). It was released as the album's eight track, produced solely by West and samples Maybe It's the Power of Love by Blackjack.[1] West and Ivy each provide one verse–the latter's is a poem–while Jay-Z has two verses. Music critics mostly had praise for it, but tended to view Jay's appearance in a negative light. In 2011, Billboard listed the song as the second greatest collaboration between Kanye and Jay. Although an accompanying music video wasn't ever produced for Never Let Me Down, the audio of it was used in one of West's videos for Jesus Walks. The song has managed to develop a significant legacy over time, despite never being released as a single.";
